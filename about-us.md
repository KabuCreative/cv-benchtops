    <p>Since our foundation in 1989, we've grown to become central Victoria's leading supplier of benchtops and hardware, now employing over 25 local staff.</p>

    <p>Founded by Craig and Ros Stephen, we began specialising in benchtops in 1992, following the purchase of a postforming machine to facilitate the rolling of laminate.  Since then, we've consistently invested in new technologies and materials to ensure we are at the cutting edge of the market.</p>

    <p>Our business has been built on two principles: exceptional quality and personal service. Consistently delivering both has cemented our local reputation and led us to be trusted by central Victoria's largest cabinet makers and commercial outfitters.</p>

    <p>Our clients span from simple domestic jobs, all the way through to large commercial projects, including Bendigo hospital and Latrobe University.</p>
