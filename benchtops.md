<h2>Engineered Stone</h2>

Engineered stone, also known as composite stone is a man-made material constructed with powdered/crushed stone and resin.
As an engineered product, it is considerably cheaper, less porous and more visually consistent than solid/natural stone, whilst maintaining a sophisticated aesthetic.

Engineered stone comes in a wide variety of colours and patterns and is a stylish addition to any home.
